<h1> What is Solar System ?</h1>

<p class="center"> Solar system, assemblage consisting of the Sun—an average star in the Milky Way Galaxy—and those bodies orbiting around it:
 8 (formerly 9) planets with more than 210 known planetary satellites (moons); 
many asteroids, some with their own satellites; comets and other icy bodies; 
and vast reaches of highly tenuous gas and dust known as the interplanetary medium.</p>

<p><b>Types of Solar System Planets</b></p>

<p></p>Mainly, there are two types of planets in our solar system:-

<ol>
<li>Terrestrial or inner planets – <mark>Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.</mark></li>
<br>
<li>Giant or outer planets –<mark> Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune </mark></li>

	<li><a href="#2">Venus</a></li>
	<li><a href="#3">Earth </a></li>

</ol>

<p><i>The planets, in order of their distance outward from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</i></p>

<h1>Terrestrial planets (inner planets)</h1>
<p>The number of terrestrial planets in our solar system is four; Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These worlds are closest to the sun and have rocky surfaces.

They are also called ‘rocky planets’ as their surface is solid in nature and contains silicate rocks and metals. The word “terrestrial” is derived from the Latin word “terra“, which means ‘land’ or ‘earth’. So all the terrestrial 
planet has an earth-like solid surface structure and a metallic core. </p> 

<h2 id ="1"> 1. Mercury</h2>

<img src="img/mercury.jpg" alt="Mercury " class="center">

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li>Mercury is the fastest and nearest planet that orbits around the sun. 
		The average distance from the Sun of Mercury is 0.387 AU.</li>
	<li>Its orbital speed is 47.87 km/sec around the sun. </li>
	<li>It completes one orbit in 88 earth days.</li>
	<li>The surface temperature of mercury ranges from ‘-175 °C to 430 °C’.</li>
	<li>Mercury is an extremely hot planet because it is the nearest to the sun. 
		Though it is not the hottest in our solar system planet.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id ="2"> 2. Venus </h2>
<img src="img/venus.jpg" alt="Mercury " class="center">

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li>It is the hottest in all eight 
		planets of our solar system even hotter than Mercury.</li>
	<li>This planet is the nearest to earth and 2nd nearest to the sun after Mercury. 
		The average distance of Venus from the sun is 0.722 AU.</li>
	<li>The surface temperature of Venus ranges from ‘-220 °C to 465 °C’.</li>
	<li>Venus has some nicknames like “evening star”, “morning star”, “veiled planet”,
		 “earth’s twin”, and “earth’s sister”</li>
		 <li>It is the 2nd fastest planet that has an orbital speed of 35.05 km/sec and it 
			completes one orbit around the sun in 225 earth days.</li>
			<li>Planet Venus has high pressure on its surface.
				 It is 92 times higher than the atmospheric pressure on earth. </li>
</ul>


<h2 id ="3">3.Earth</h2>
<img src="img/Earth.jpg" alt="Earth " class="center">

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>Earth is the largest
		 terrestrial planet and the only known planet that has life on it. </li>
	<li>It is the 3rd planet from the sun with a mean distance of around 1 AU.</li>
	<li>It travels around the sun with a speed of 29.78 km/sec and completes
		 one orbit in 365.24 earth days.</li>
	<li>The magnetosphere of the earth protects us from harmful solar and cosmic winds. </li>
	<li>It is known as a ‘blue planet’ and ‘watery planet’ because of the large amount of water present on it.</li>
	<li>71% surface of the earth is covered with water.</li>
	<li>The atmosphere of the earth has a supportive living environment. Earth’s atmosphere has been divided into 
		different types of layers for different purposes.</li>
	<li>Earth has an ozone layer in its atmosphere that protects
		 us from the harmful ultraviolet radiation of the sun.</li>

</ul>


<h2 id ="4">4. Mars </h2>
<img src="img/mars.jpg" alt="Mars" class="center">
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li>The orbital speed of the mass is 24.07 km/sec and it completes one orbit around the sun in 687 earth days. The mean orbital path of Mars is almost 1.52 AU from the sun. </li>
	<li>It is also a ‘red planet’ because of a large amount of iron oxide present on it, which gives it a reddish appearance.</li>
	<li>Mars has two natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos.</li>
	<li>The highest known mountain ‘Olympus Mons’ is on mars. It is approximately 22 km high.</li>
	<li>Mars will also have a ring around it in the future. It is estimated that its moon Phobos will tear apart 
		after 30 million years which would create a ring around it.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Giant planets (outer planets)</h1>
<p>There are also four giant planets; Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Jupiter and Saturn are called ‘gas giant planets’ whereas Uranus and Neptune are called ‘ice giant planets’.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li>They are quite bigger in size, that’s why they are known as “giant worlds”.</li>
	<p>The outer planets are mostly made of gases like hydrogen, helium, methane, and ammonia.
		 These worlds are massive and they have rings around them.</p>
	<li>One of the interesting facts about the outer planet is, 
		that you can not stand on its surface as these are made of gases.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id ="5">5. Jupiter</h2>
<img src="img/Jupter.jpg" alt="Jupiter" class="center">

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>Jupiter is the largest and most massive of all 8 planets of our solar system with a mass of 1.9 × 1027 kg.</li>
	<li>The mass of Jupiter is more than 2.5 times greater than the mass of all other combined planets. Its mass is 318 times greater than the mass of the earth.</li>
    <li>Planet Jupiter is known as the winter planet because of its low average temperature of -148 °C.</li>
    <li>Jupiter has the shortest day compared to all planets that complete one spin around its axis in 9 hours and 55 minutes.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id ="6">6. Saturn </h2>
<img src="img/Saturn.jpg" alt="Saturn" class="center">
<ul>
	<li>This planet is the 2nd largest in our solar system with a mass of 5.7 × 10<sup>26</sup> kg.</li>
	<li>It is the sixth planet from the sun with a mean distance of 9.58 AU.</li>
	<li>Our Saturn has the most number of moons in comparison to all other solar system planets. It has 82 moons with confirmed orbits.  
		Moon ‘Titan’ is the largest of Saturn and 2nd largest in the solar system.</li>
	
</ul>


<h2 id ="7">7. Uranus</h2>
<img src="img/Uranus.jpg" alt="Uranus" class="center">

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>It was the 1st planet that was discovered by using a telescope in 1781 AD. Uranus is quite farther and the average distance of this planet is approximately 19.20 AU.</li>
	<li>Uranus is an ice-giant planet and it is the coldest planet in our solar system with a recorded minimum temperature of ‘-224 °C’.</li>
	<li>The orbital speed of the universe is 6.81 km/sec and it completes one revolution around the sun in 84 earth years.</li>
	<li>It has 27 known moons and the size of Uranus is about 4 times greater than the earth. (Read about- all the moons of Uranus)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id ="8">8. Neptune</h2>
<img src="img/Neptune.jpg" alt="Neptune" class="center">

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li>Neptune is the eighth planet from the sun and the farthest one among all 8 planets of the solar system. 
		The farthest planet has an average distance from the sun is 30.10 AU.</li>
	<li>Since it is not visible to the naked eye so could not be discovered by ancient people.</li>
	<li>It was 1st observed by John Couch Adams in 1846 AD.</li>
	<li>It has 14 known moons of which ‘Triton’ is the largest.</li>
